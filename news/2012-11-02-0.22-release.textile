We're happy to announce the first official release of Æsh!
It took us a bit more time that first planned, but then this release is one of the bigger one we've had. The single biggest thing is a <a href=/docs/base/parser/>command line parser</a>, but there are also many enhancements and bug fixes. The release notes can be found <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12312720&version=12320251">here</a>. Enjoy!
