First... - sorry for the lack of documentation updates!
Æsh has been continously updated and is used in even more projects than before. 
After version 0.33 we made some big changes to the API. - we made Æsh multithreaded!
The biggest change is that Console.read(..) is gone as you know it. Instead we've added a callback (called ConsoleCallback) which will be called whenever the user press enter. 
Æsh extensions is also pushed to maven and has some very exiting features like less,more and man. More info regarding the extensions will be added later.
- and yes, the docs are updated to the latest API changes.

Enjoy!
