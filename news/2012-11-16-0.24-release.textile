We have been pushing out new releases fairly often recently. 
0.23 was released last friday, the release notes can be found <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12312720&version=12320575">here</a>.
Today we released version <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12312720&version=12320602">0.24</a>.
There are no API changes except that the <a href="https://github.com/aeshell/aesh/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/aesh/util/ANSI.java">ANSI.class</a> was changed to better work in combination with other strings.
The command line parser was also enhanced to better support quotes and escaped spaces.
Æsh also support multiline edits with the use of \ at the end of the line which is similar to how it work on posix shells.
We've also added a better way of controlling logging. From now on no logging will be performed if its not enabled in Settings or by setting the aesh.logging property to true.
Enjoy!
