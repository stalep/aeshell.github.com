%br
This is just the beginning of JReadline documentation so please be patient. If you have ideas for documentation or find certain areas lacking, do not hesitate to contact us and help out.
%p
If you just want to try out JReadline, take a look at the <a href="/docs/base/">Getting started</a> section.

The documentation is written in Textile, which is a lightweight markup language. 
%br
Follow these steps to conribute documentation:
%ol
  %li Clone http://github.com/jreadline/jreadline.github.com on GitHub.
  %li Add a new .textile file in one of the sub directories of the docs directory. 
  %li Push the empty Textile file to your GitHub repository.
  %li Use the GitHub Textile editor to write your docs and preview changes. Of course you can use your own editor if you prefer so.

The Textile Wikipedia 
%a{ :href => 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)'} page 
gives a good introduction about the markup language.
