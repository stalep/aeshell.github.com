h1. FAQ

<br/>

h3. How is Æsh different from Jline1/2?

The Æsh started out of some of the shortcomings of Jline and its API is somewhat similar for getting output from console. Completion/Settings/etc is howevery different but changing from Jline to Æsh should not require much work.

h3. I found an issue, where can I report it?

Create an issue on our jira project page: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AESH

h3. How can I contribute to Æsh?

More generally, see "this":/docs/contribute.html

h3. What about JReadline?

Even though we liked the JReadline name, we thought that the project outlived that name since it evolved into something more than just a readline library.
