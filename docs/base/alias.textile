h1. Aliases

<p/>
JReadline provide alias functionality similar to Bash alias. 

For those that do not know what aliases is, it allows a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command. JReadline maintains  a  list  of aliases  that  may  be set and unset with the <kbd>alias</kbd> and <kbd>unalias</kbd> commands.

JReadline always read a complete line of input before executing. Aliases are expanded when a command is read.

h2. Set/Unset Aliases

<p/>
Aliases are created with the <kbd>alias</kbd> command either in the shell or specified in a file thats read when jreadline starts. This file can be set in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> class. The format to define aliases is: <kbd>alias aliasname='command -params'</kbd>. This is identical in a shell and file.

To remove an existing alias specify the name of the alias after the <kbd>unalias</kbd> command. eg: <kbd>unalias aliasname</kbd>.
